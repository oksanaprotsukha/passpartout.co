#### Day 1: 2020-Feb-27 

Hobart to Cockle Creek: uber, 2.5 hr
Cockle Creek to South Cape Bay campsite: 2 hr, easy grade trail, strong winds and rain

Just two days ago we celebrated my birthday in Cradle Mountain national park. It’s a special place with a fascinating nature and scenery. The experience deserves its own post. Our original plan was to leave Tasmania on the day after my birthday and head to Vietnam via Melbourne. However, having been concerned with the quarantine orders due to coronavirus  in Vietnam, and with so many things to do and see in Tasmania, we decided to extend our stay here by 1 week and explore the Southwestern National Park. It is known as the ultimate wilderness area of Australia and is a home to some of the most famed bushwalking tracks in Australia. South Coast Track was recommended as an excellent multi day trip by a seasoned bushwalker Hanna whom we met during our visit to Blue Mountains near Sydney.  
It’s quite interesting to notice how a self-sufficient multi-day hiking activity is known by so many different names (backpacking in the US, tramping in New Zealand, bushwalking in Australia...). South Coast Track is considered a fairly easy 6-7 days walk over 85 km in the deep wilderness by local standards. With only 2 mountain passes, including one that boasts 900 m elevation gain from the sea level, multiple creek crossings with water levels sometimes hips deep, forests full of mud holes and always changing weather, it’s apparently a regular terrain for the experienced Tasmanian bushwalkers. Gravel road leads to one side of the trail at Cockle Creek and an airstrip at Melaleuca links the other end with the civilization. Most people fly in and then get a drive out. This ensures that one does not get stuck in the wilderness should the bad weather make it impossible to fly an aircraft to pick up the trekkers.  
Due to the heavy rain and low clouds forecasted on our departure day and improvements in the weather afterwards, we were advised to start from the opposite side and fly out instead. We budgeted an extra day in our itinerary to account for bad weather or unexpected events on the trail and decided to proceed with the plan. We would start at Cockle Creek and 7 days later fly out from Melaleuca. 
We purchased all our food the day before in our favorite store Hill Street Grocer in West Hobart. We got spoiled with the camping grade food options in Tasmania. Our hike promised to be as much a feast for the soul as a feast for the stomach. In our food bag we had local truffle cheddar, leatherwood honey, fresh loaves of french style bread from a local italian bakery, tea and coffee, dry Sicilian-style salami made in Melbourne, smoked Tasmanian salmon, couscous, mash potatoes and loads of local dried fruits and healthy snacks. What we had trouble finding was a good bar of locally made chocolate. We went with tried Whittaker's chocolate bar from New Zealand.

On the day of departure we had a late start since it took much longer to get to the trailhead than anticipated. While we initially planned on taking a public transportation, the cost of the public bus to Dover and a taxi from Dover to the trailhead in Cockle Creek was not much cheaper than taking uber all the way. We opted for uber this time to make the logistics of getting to the trailhead more efficient. The trailhead is 2.5 hours ride from Hobart and it felt even longer in uber. When we reached a section with a gravel road we were concerned that the driver would change his mind of taking us all the way to the final destination. He did not. We got dropped off right at the trailhead around 4pm. We got out of the car right into the gusty wind, roaring 40s in all their power. Rain was about to start. Park ranger checked advised to camp in the campground and start tomorrow instead. However, after she checked the weather and considering that we had to be at Melaleuca on March 4th, said that we should have enough daylight to make it to South Cape Bay campsite and should not continue tonight to the more common South Cape Rivulet Campsite.  
It was already 4:20 pm, windy, drizzly and gloomy when we started the track. Luckily, the first section of the trail was a nice and easy walk through a well-maintained trail. It took us a little bit less than two hours to reach the coast. Black sand, ominous sky and formidable waves left us in awe. Nature is beautiful in its menace.

We passed the plaque that read “You are standing at the Southernmost point of Australia”. It added to the feeling of being isolated.

We carefully crossed over the rocky trail along the beach and found ourselves at the well maintained if somewhat overgrown staircase. It led to the first campsite, where we decided to set up the tent for the night. If given good weather and absence of snakes, we could have easily made it to the planned South Cape Rivulet Campsite. However, tonight it was a wise decision to enjoy an early dinner and rest before an arduous day tomorrow. At the campsite were only birds and us. Heavy rain started right after we set up the tent. After our delicious dinner - couscous with cod liver pate and bits of cheese - was ready and we were soaked, we got to appreciate the luxury of our dry and comfy tent and enjoy the meal. We left our dishes outside for rain to clean and cuddled up in the tent. After few pages of our kindles we were ready to get some sleep.
